# CustomMapping

A simple example of how to change the mapping functionality of Xamarin Maps. In this case, instead of using a normal pin, we use a 
user image.

This example also uses the Xamarin Geolocator plugin.

To get it to work for Android, you will need to get a mapping API key and follow the instructions on the Xamarin website for using it.

iOS works out the tin.

Released under the extremely liberal DILLIGAF licence. This licence does not change the licence that either Xam.Forms, Xam.Forms.Maps or 
the Geolocator plugin use.
